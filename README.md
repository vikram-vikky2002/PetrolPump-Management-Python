# PetrolPump-Management-Python

Petrol Pump Management System is a computer-based software solution that aims to simplify and automate the operations of a petrol pump. This project is developed using Python programming language and uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the user's interaction with the system.

The software provides a range of features to manage the daily operations of a petrol pump, including:

1. **Pump management :** The system allows the user to manage the pumps at the petrol station, enabling them to monitor the status of each pump and track fuel sales for each pump.

2. **Inventory management :** The software helps the user keep track of fuel inventory, including the fuel type, quantity, and price. It provides alerts for low inventory levels, allowing the user to order new stock in advance.

3. **Sales management :** The system allows the user to record fuel sales and generate tranaction history

Overall, the Petrol Pump Management System developed using Python is a user-friendly, feature-rich software solution that simplifies and automates the daily operations of a petrol pump. It helps the user to streamline their operations, save time and effort, and make informed decisions based on accurate data.
